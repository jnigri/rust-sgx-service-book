We are using [hyper](https://hyper.rs/guides/0.14/server/hello-world/) in this tutorial.
Because we are using the [v2.0.0-preview](https://github.com/apache/incubator-teaclave-sgx-sdk/tree/v2.0.0-preview) of the rust SGX SDK, we can simply add [hyper](https://crates.io/crates/hyper) to our `Cargo.toml`.
Hyper works with asynchronous calls and therefore needs [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
Thus we should add the following to the `Cargo.toml` file inside the `enclave` folder:
```toml
[dependencies]
hyper = { version = "0.14", features = ["full"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```
